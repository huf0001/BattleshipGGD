Tried to run this version once all the fixing of compile errors
was done. That didn't go so well; there was a run error that 
was complaining about no entry into the SwinGame library or
something.

Transferred code, image, and sound resources to a Visual
Studio/Xamarin compatible project, builds just fine. Has an
error or two relating to sound files, but we can worry about 
that tomorrow or something, I've had enough for today.
